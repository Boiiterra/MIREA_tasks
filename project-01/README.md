# Project 01

This is just a simple calculator like project-00 which is [here](https://github.com/boiiterra/little-calc)
but with some extra stuff in it. \
This calculator is capable of doing math with different numeral systems ([Sorry what?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system)).\
\
For example: \
101[2] + 2[3] = 7[8]
