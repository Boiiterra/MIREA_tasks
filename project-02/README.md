# Project 02

Basically another damn calculator.\
But...\
This one is a bit different than [project 01](../project-01).\
This one calculates logical expressions that are given by the user.\
LIMITATIONS: supports one - four variables.\
\
Example:\
F = a -> (b and (not a))

| a | b | F |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
